                    <p>
                        This is Rachel. She is an Applied Mathematics major from Southern California. She graduated from San Diego State University. She is a smart, charming, and very humble person. With all the challenges she has faced, she has persevered and has completed all the goals she has set her mind to. 
                        
                        Whenever life gives her a hard time she knows it is only temporary, She knows what she wants and gets it done. A long-term toxic relationship would set anyone back and cause most people to abandon their goals, but not Rachel. Being in college and breaking up with your partner could put a strain on already hard classes. Instead, she chose to keep her focus on her goal in mind. After completing this astonishing feat, She has been trying to kick-start her career by applying to every job. Having so many back-to-back challenges with a toxic relationship, hard classes, and a bad job market. None of these will be her demise. She worked through so much to get to where she is today and has had so much support from the tight-knit people around her. 
                        
                        She is very intelligent and applies herself to everything! No matter how hard or how much she does not want to do it. Even when she is sedentary, she is productive with Learning about true crime, Minecraft, or honing her skills in knitting. All in all, Rachel is reliable, unsurprisingly tough, and knows how to complete her mission. No person, thing, or divine intervention will stop her from doing what is best and true to her growth and future.
