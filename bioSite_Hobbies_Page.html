                    <h3>Minecraft</h3>
                    <p>
                        When Rachel plays Minecraft it is for fun and also learning. Whether she builds a 10,000-block sculpture or a red stone contraption, she is always learning and taking a mental load off when playing. Her favorite thing to do in the game is build cute little houses. She loves to play with her best friend during his breaks from school. She is looking forward to his next break so they can defeat the Ender Dragon together.

                    <h3>Knitting</h3>
                    <p>
                        When she needs something to do she will knit for a little bit just to keep her hands busy. She might not be able to make a perfect sweater but she will be able to make a lovely scarf! She enjoys crafts that result in wearable garments. After learning the basics of knitting, she is now moving on to learn how to sew.

                    <h3>Painting</h3>
                    <p>
                        When she wants to give a gift the first thought is “I’ll make a painting!” it could be about anything, from portraits to more abstract her paintings always have sentimental meanings. The last painting she made was a picture of her friend and herself as Halloween creatures. She enjoys listening to podcasts while she paints.
